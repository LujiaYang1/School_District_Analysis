# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
We have complete the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:
A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school

However, the school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We would like to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, and explore how these changes affected the overall analysis once we've replaced the math and reading scores.

## Results
1)How is the district summary affected?
